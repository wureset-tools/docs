Contents Run as administrator Command line Run as administrator User Account Control (UAC) is a mandatory access control enforcement facility introduced with Microsoft's Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 operating systems, with a more relaxed version also present in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 10. It aims to improve the security of Microsoft Windows by limiting application software to standard user privileges until an administrator authorizes an increase or elevation. In this way, only applications trusted by the user may receive administrative privileges, and malware should be kept from compromising the operating system. In other words, a user account may have administrator privileges assigned to it, but applications that the user runs do not inherit those privileges unless they are approved beforehand or the user explicitly authorizes it. How to run a program as an administrator To run a program as an administrator, follow these steps: Right-click the icon that you use to run the program, and then click Run as administrator . When you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the administrator password, or click Continue .

It aims to improve the security of Microsoft Windows by limiting application software to standard user privileges until an administrator authorizes an increase or elevation. In this way, only applications trusted by the user may receive administrative privileges, and malware should be kept from compromising the operating system. In other words, a user account may have administrator privileges assigned to it, but applications that the user runs do not inherit those privileges unless they are approved beforehand or the user explicitly authorizes it.","title":"Run as administrator"},{"location":"usage/#how-to-run-a-program-as-an-administrator","text":"To run a program as an administrator, follow these steps: Right-click the icon that you use to run the program, and then click Run as administrator .
