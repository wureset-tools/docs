## Why it does not work in Windows XP/Vista/7?

The script version of this tool can be used to restore the Windows Update components in older operating systems such as Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8. However, it's important to note that Microsoft ended the extended support for these operating systems in 2014 (Windows XP), 2017 (Windows Vista), 2020 (Windows 7) and 2023 (Windows 8 and 8.1). This means that these operating systems are no longer receiving security updates, making them vulnerable to cyber threats. It's recommended to upgrade to a newer and supported operating system for better security and performance.

## Can I use it on Windows Server?

This tool is fully compatible with Windows 10 or higher, as well as Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2, and 2016. However, it's important to note that using this tool on a Windows Server may lead to the removal of certain configurations related to Firewall, Domain, and other settings. As such, it's recommended to exercise caution when using this tool on a Windows Server environment.
