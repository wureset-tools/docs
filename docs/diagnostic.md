# Diagnostic

While the primary purpose of the Reset Windows Update Tool is to reset the Windows Update Components, its development has enabled the tool to perform other functions for problem-solving purposes.

The various correction processes can be broadly divided into three groups:

<dl>
<dt>Control processes</dt>
<dd>are simple processes that may involve small changes in the system, for example: restore Internet connections or restart the computer.<dd>
<dt>Correction processes</dt>
<dd>are those that allow us to solve major problems in the system, for example: Reset Windows Update Components or Scans all protectedsystem files.</dd>
<dt>Invasive processes</dt>
<dd>are those who suggest repair or reinstall the system.</dd>
</dl>

It is recommended to conduct some tests to identify the root cause of the issue and determine the best course of action.

## Restore Point

In case something goes wrong, you can restore your computer to the last restore point.

To create a restore point, select the first option in the main menu. This will open the System Protection window.

Here, you can create a restore point by simply clicking the "Create" button.

If this option is disabled, click on the "Configure" button and select "Turn on system protection" to enable it.

## Removing temporary

To delete temporary files, select the option labeled "Delete temporary files in Windows". This option will automatically remove any temporary files stored on your system.

## Reset Internet Explorer

To reset Internet Explorer, select the option labeled "Open Internet Explorer Options". This will open the Internet Options window.

Next, select the "Advanced" tab and click on the "Reset" button to reset Internet Explorer to its default settings.

## Restart your PC

After completing a system solution process, it is recommended to restart the computer in order to save any changes that were made.

You can restart your PC manually, or choose the option labeled "Restart your PC" to automatically restart your computer. This option provides a one-minute warning to save any work you may be doing before the restart occurs.

## Reset the Winsock settings

To restore Internet connections, select the "Reset Winsock Settings" option. This feature restores Internet access settings, removes any access restrictions, and fixes errors such as 0x8024042C and others that may be preventing you from connecting to the Internet.

After selecting this option, the tool will apply the necessary changes to your system. It is recommended to restart your computer after this process is completed to ensure the changes take effect.

## Automatically fix problem

To further troubleshoot Windows Update issues, we recommend using the Fix-It tool. You can access this tool by selecting the 'Explore other local solutions' option.

The 'Fix problem with Windows Update' tool can identify the error code associated with the issue, which can help you find a solution. If the error code is not displayed, you can download the 'Fix-It' tool to search for the error code.
