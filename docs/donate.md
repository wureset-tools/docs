In 2015, the script version "ResetWUEng.cmd" was released as a support tool to troubleshoot problems with Windows Update. Five years later, with the end of support for the Microsoft "TechNet Gallery" scripts gallery in June 2020, there is a need to centralize the updated versions of the Reset Windows Update Tool in a new location.

### A bit of context

Microsoft's operating systems receive new updates month after month. Similarly, updates are required for the Reset Windows Update Tool, although not with the same frequency. However, updating this tool requires significant time and effort, which is often undertaken by a single person.

Therefore, to streamline the update process and ensure that the tool is available in multiple languages, I have reached out to the community for help with translation. The work is substantial, and I will continue to work with the community to create a more appealing version in the future.

For now, you can download the latest versions of the tool from the https://wureset.com/ website.

### There is still reality to contend with

Over the past few months, we've been impacted by the fluctuation of the dollar and the rising costs of domain and hosting services. To address this, we had to migrate to more affordable options, which unfortunately led to connection failures with our website, https://wureset.com/.

We're happy to report that we now have a stable service and hope to continue offering it for many years to come. However, we rely on donations to cover our expenses and keep the service running smoothly. Your contributions will go a long way in helping us maintain a reliable and accessible platform for users to download the Reset Windows Update Tool.
